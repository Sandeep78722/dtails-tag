Unaware of this situation, Tamayo asks for help from the military to end the hostage situation at the bank, and — in his pursuit of the Professor — to raid Benjamín's farm after the sighting there of the vehicle used in Lisbon's escape. When the vehicle is stopped, the raiding team finds out it is being driven merely by another farmer whom the Professor earlier hired as an accomplice. In flashbacks, Berlín asks his son, a cyber-security expert named Rafael, to join his heist.

            As the army arrives, Lisbon, Tokyo, and Stockholm bring some of the hostages outside the bank. The three come to the front of the hostages and declare to Tamayo's men their desire to negotiate the gang's surrender. When Tamayo comes out and meets the three for the negotiation, Lisbon tells him they will first release Gandía who needs medical attention. There and then she also realizes that the negotiators are unaware of Sierra's capture of the Professor, so the three buy time by going back inside the bank to supposedly 'consult with the Professor', bringing the hostages back inside with them. During a fistfight between Gandia, Tokyo and Bogota, Arturo snatches a number of weapons and escapes with his group, injuring Denver in the shootout. He and Urbaneja end up in the loading dock, where the gang's arsenal are stashed. Stockholm, outraged by Arturo's intercom conversation with her about their son, shoots him. Meanwhile, Sierra captures Benjamín and Marseille who have arrived at the hideout.

Sierra unties her captives when she realizes she needs their assistance to deliver her child. In flashbacks, Berlin continues to persuade his son to join him in heists while Moscow convinces Benjamín to allow Manila to join the Professor's team.

                In flashbacks it is seen how the Professor recruited Tokyo, after her boyfriend died during a bank heist, and how she later developed feelings for Rio. At the bank, snipers shoot Tokyo while her partners keep trying to find ways of attacking Sagasta's group. Despite hallucinations after shooting Arturo, Stockholm treats Helsinki and suggests to Denver the use of a service lift to escape Sagasta's team's attack. Denver and Rio devise plans to rescue Tokyo, but with Sagasta's team closing in on her, she allows them to gun her down and surround her before detonating grenades to blow them all up.

Lisbon agrees to allow doctors into the bank while one of Sagasta's soldiers hides and secretly defuses bombs around the entrances of the bank so special forces could easily enter. In a flashback, Berlin's wife, Tatiana, leaves him for his own son, Rafael.

                In a flashback, The Professor sees his father killed by guards during a heist. At the bank, Tamayo asks Denver to make a deal and tell him where the gold is. Denver refuses and is handed over to police outside the bank. Videos of the heist are released online by The Professor's hackers in Pakistan, showing gold being flushed out of the bank, impacting the stock market dramatically, but Tamayo does not agree to strike a deal with The Professor. Police search for the gold in the wrong locations due to fake clues left by Marseille. Sierra tracks down Rafael and Tatiana, who stole the gold bars, and gives them a message from The Professor. The Professor assures Tamayo that the gold will be returned to the bank if he releases a statement saying that the matter has been peacefully resolved. The news of the trucks bringing the gold back helps stabilize the stock market, but Tamayo discovers the blocks are gold-painted brass. The Professor tells Tamayo that the fake gold bars will save the country's economy, giving him an ultimatum to either continue the lie and let them escape, or reveal the blocks are fake which will topple the economy. Tamayo faces the press and lies that The Professor and his team died while Denver will stay in witness protection after "revealing" the location of the gold; he also announces that the hostages and gold reserves are safe, restoring confidence in the Spanish economy. The Professor and his team get new identities and use the gold that Sierra carried across the border to Portugal, and the note is revealed to be a promise to give Rafael and Tatiana a cut. The Professor and his team fly off in an army helicopter to an undisclosed location to start their new lives.
